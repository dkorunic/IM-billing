INFO:
This is a simple Google calendar based tracking/billing system. When you
have a set of tasks performed in your Google calendar with each of the
entries belonging to a specific "sub" calendar, you can easily print out
those for a specific (and any) time frame, sum them and make a simple
billing calculation.

REQUIREMENTS:
